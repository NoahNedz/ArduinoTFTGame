Hardware: Adafruit's 120x120 TFT Screen, Arduino Uno
Goal: Program basic games and eventually create a 
mobile assembly using a Nano so that games can be 
played on the go. 3D printing an enclosure and 
fitting it with the appropriate hardware so that
it is a robust device that can entertain children
and adults as well as introduce beginners programming
and hardware.
